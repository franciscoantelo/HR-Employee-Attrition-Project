# HR-Employee-Attrition-Project

This repository was created to manage the work within the project for the Enterprise Data Science Bootcamp class. <P>
On the basis of this course, we chose to analyze the HR challenge of building a model to predict the probability of a given emplooyee quiting its job.<P>

For this case, we worked with a multinational consulting company - BI4ALL <P>

## The project will focus its analysis on 2 main topics:
### Descriptive Analytics:
  - *Performing EDA.*
  - *Finding Correlations between the variables.*
  - *Analysing clusters between the data.*
  - *Building visualizations to get better insights for analysis.*
  - *Checking cardinality.*
  - *Removing redundant features.*

### Predictive Analytics:
  - *Provide a rundown of relevant performance metrics.*
  - *Build classification models to predict the Attrition probability.*
  - *Provide suggestions on how to implement the model into production.*

This repository is organized in the following way:<P>

- *1. Problem Description* contains a single PDF file with a description of the work to be done.<P>
- *2. Literature* has a series of articles we used to assist in our analysis. <P>
- *3. Data & Code* is the main directory with both the data and the final code of the whole project. <P>
- *4. Presentation* has a PowerPoint presentation of our findings, as well as some imagery and resources that led to it. <P>
- *5. Extras* represents some tests made using Amazon Sagemaker, but put on hold given budget worries and constraints. <P>
